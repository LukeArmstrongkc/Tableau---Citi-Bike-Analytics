## Background

Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the [New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike) Program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers. 

## Task

* My homework was completed in two separate stories. One story covered the Jersey City Bike Trip Histories. The other was based on Daily/Annual membership Ride Data.
* I covered about 11 diffferent questions, to get a good feel for differen facets of the data. These range from gender and age, to distance and positioning, to memberhip and purchase data. Two maps were included on one of the story pages as well, so that a dashboard was integrated to one of the stories.# Tableau-Assignment---Citi-Bike-Analytics
